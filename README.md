# QuarkNet Data Camp  

These activities were developed for QuarkNet Data Camp, a  weeklong summer workshop at Fermilab for high school physics teachers. You can run the notebooks in Google Colab (requires a Google login, though) or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run Jupyter locally on your computer. To download a notebook and run in locally, right-click or command-click the download link and select "save link as".  

## Coding Camp 1    
- **Intro to Jupyter**: start here if you haven't used a Juypter notebook before. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/blob/main/intro.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/raw/main/intro.ipynb).  
- **CMS Event Analysis**: Analyze particle events form the CMS detector at CERN. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/blob/main/CMS_event_analysis.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/raw/main/CMS_event_analysis.ipynb).
