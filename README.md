# QuarkNet Data Camp  

These activities were developed for QuarkNet Data Camp, a  weeklong summer workshop at Fermilab for high school physics teachers. You can run the notebooks in Google Colab (requires a Google login, though) or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run Jupyter locally on your computer. To download a notebook and run in locally, right-click or command-click the download link and select "save link as".  

## Coding Camp 1    
- **Intro to Jupyter**: start here if you haven't used a Juypter notebook before. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/blob/main/intro.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/raw/main/intro.ipynb).  
- **CMS Event Analysis**: Analyze particle events form the CMS detector at CERN. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/blob/main/CMS_event_analysis.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/QuarkNet-HEP/data-camp/raw/main/CMS_event_analysis.ipynb).  

# Datasets
These can be found in the /data folder and are used in mass plot activities. All datasets come from the CMS detector at CERN and are courtesy of the hard work done by Tom McCauley to convert them from their original ROOT files.
* 2011 Muon & Electron Runs - Use for Z, J / $\psi$, and $\Upsilon$ mass plots
* 2011 Single Muon & Electron Runs - Use for W Boson mass plots

>For 2015 Runs, the files are hosted on Google Drive. Use the following URLs to access the csv files:
